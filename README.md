# Python-API-Challenge
It has folders WeatherPy and VacationPy challenges. Each contains the respective jupyter notebook with script
There is an Images folder as well that has 4 scatter plots and 8 Linear Regression model plots.All of them are png files.
The WeatherPy folder has a csv file of the cities(cities.csv file).
For security purposes, I have not included the api_keys.py file. I used the 'weather_api_key' and 'g_key' to run the code.
I am including the empty api_keys.py file so that you can put in your respective api keys.
